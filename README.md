Making easy for Sierra Leone people to manage stable crypto coins.

Running  on <https://stable-sl.pdJ.app>


## Problem

In Sierra Leone few people manages a crypto wallet or an exchange and at the
moment of this writing FonBnk doesn't support Sierra Leone. There are 
interesting saving and investment options in the web3, but this requires 
tools and education. We want to create tools and promote education about 
this in Sierra Leone.

## Solution

* We want to become merchants/partners of FonBnk in Sierra Leone (possibly with
    Orange Money and EcoBank)
* Building a webapp or app that will make easy to buy/sell stable crypto to the
    people of Sierra Leone.
* Educate the people in the usage of stable cryptocoins and saving and 
    investment opportunities.
