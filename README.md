Making easy to buy and sell stable crypto for people from Sierra Leone

Prototype running  on <https://stable-sl.pdJ.app>

## Problem

In Sierra Leone few people manages a crypto wallet or an exchange and at the
moment of this writing neither FonBnk nor MiniPay support Sierra Leone. 
There are interesting saving and investment options in the web3, but this requires 
tools and education. We want to create tools and promote education about 
this in Sierra Leone.

## Solution
* Building a webapp or app that will make easy to buy/sell stable crypto to the
    people of Sierra Leone.
* Educate the people in the usage of stable cryptocoins and saving and 
    investment opportunities.
* Initially we propose to FonBnk to be their partners in Sierra Leone, but later
  they told us that they already had a team.
  Anyway after some months of our conversation they still don't support the currency,
  neither payment methods of Sierra Leone in their sandbox.
* So at least while FonBnk or another group offers an on-ramp/off-ramp solution
  we will start to build one, operating with a local team based on the Mission Hope
  School located in Kabala (the school is lead by the pastor Zechariah Conteh who is
  in the team).
